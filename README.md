## Dataset Description
The dataset is fully synthetic and generated from scratch.

It consists of two main components:
- **Image Dataset**: image-based LiDAR representations
- **Sequence Dataset**: temporal LiDAR scan sequences for recurrent neural network training

The dataset includes data generated for three different spacecraft models:
- Aquarius
- Magellan
- NEAR Shoemaker

Due to its large size, the complete dataset is hosted on **Zenodo**.
